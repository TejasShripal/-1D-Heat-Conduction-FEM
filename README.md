# -1D-Heat-Conduction-FEM
 Modeled and solved 1D heat conduction in a homogeneous brake disc using cylindrical coordinates, simplifying to radial heat transfer due to uniformity in angular and axial directions.
 Implemented Newton's boundary condition at the disc edge to simulate heat dissipation with the environment, incorporating varying heat exchange coefficients.
 Formulated governing heat conduction equations and applied the Finite Element Method (FEM) to derive a system of equations representing the thermal behavior under frictional heating.
 Developed a Python-based numerical solver to solve the FEM equations and retrieve temperature profiles across the brake disc over time.
